# Most optional dependencies are autodetected and having the required
# libs in place will build the respective features automatically.
#
# The group can be specified at build time like this:
# VIRTGROUP=somegroup ./libvirt.SlackBuild (default: users)
# You'll want to keep this in sync with what qemu uses (it also
# defaults to the "users" group).
#
# If you want to start the libvirt daemon at boot, add this
# to /etc/rc.d/rc.local
#
#   # Start libvirt:
#   if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.libvirt ]; then
#     /etc/rc.d/rc.libvirt start
#   fi
# and if you want it to stop at shutdown add this to
# /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown
#
#   # Stop libvirt:
#   if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.libvirt ]; then
#     /etc/rc.d/rc.libvirt stop
#   fi

# Have a look at the commented part of rc.libvirt for some gotchas.
