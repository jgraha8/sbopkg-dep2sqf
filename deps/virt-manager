# To run virt-manager as a normal user, you need to configure libvirt
# to have the correct permissions.  Uncomment the unix_sock_group and
# unix_sock_rw_perms in /etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf and add the user to the
# group libvirt uses.
#
# If you have python3 installed at build-time, this probably won't work,
# so you'll need to temporarily uninstall python3 for the build process.

libosinfo
libvirt-glib
