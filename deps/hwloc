# numactl:
# libnuma provides conversion helpers between hwloc CPU setsand
# libnuma-specific types, such as bitmasks. It helps you use libnuma
# memory-binding functions with hwloc CPU sets.

# cudatoolkit:
# CUDA enables interoperability with NVIDIA CUDA Driver and Runtime
# interfaces. For instance, it may return the list of processors near
# NVIDIA GPUs. Note that if I/O device discovery is enabled, GPUs may
# also appear as PCI objects in the topology.
