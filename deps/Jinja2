# Circular dependencies warning: The DOCS=yes flag needs the optional
# dependency Sphinx, which needs Jinja2, which needs Sphinx because
# DOCS=yes ... So...  If you really need the docs, build Jinja2
# without the DOCS=yes flag, build Sphinx, then rebuild Jinja2 with
# DOCS=yes.  Incidentally, unless you are a developer, you don't
# normally need the DOCS=yes flag.
