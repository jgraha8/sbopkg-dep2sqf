# Circular dependency: 
#
# Pygments with build option HTML=1 requires Sphinx which as Pygments
# as a required package Here Sphinx is disabled in order to avoid the
# circular dependency while processing the sqf file. However, the
# Pygments entry will be before Sphinx in the sqf file with the HTML=1
# option (if enabled) and must be manually moved after Sphinx with a simple
# Pygment line in its place (without the HTML=1 option).
