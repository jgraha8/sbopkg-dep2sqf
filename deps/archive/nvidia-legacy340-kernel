# To build the package for a kernel different from the running one,
# start the script setting the KERNEL variable as in
#     KERNEL=3.2.34 ./nvidia-kernel.SlackBuild
#
# A default config file is placed at /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-nvidia.conf
# to make sure that X loads the nvidia module.  If you need to make changes, 
# copy that file to /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/ and edit the copy.  You do not need 
# this file at all if you have a proper and complete xorg.conf.
#
# The xf86-video-nouveau-blacklist package from /extra is required.
