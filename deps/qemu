# By default, this script builds only the x86 and arm emulation targets
# for qemu; if you prefer to build all supported targets, do this:
#
#   TARGETS=all ./qemu.SlackBuild
#
# Disable vnc support via:
#
#   VNC_ENABLE=no ./qemu.SlackBuild
#
# Audio drivers support defaults to "pa,alsa,oss,sdl" and can be adusted e.g.
#
# AUDIODRIVERS="pa,alsa,oss" ./qemu.SlackBuild
#
# We patch the installed udev rules to require membership in "users" 
# group instead of a custom "kvm" group to use /dev/kvm.  If you prefer
# something different, then run the build script like this:
#  
#   KVMGROUP=group ./qemu.SlackBuild
#
# Don't forget to load the 'kvm-intel' or 'kvm-amd' module (depending on 
# your processor) prior to launching qemu-system-ARCH with kvm enabled.
# For older/unmaintained qemu frontends, this build also creates a symlink
# to qemu-system-ARCH at /usr/bin/qemu-kvm.
#
# libcacard, spice, usbredir, virglrenderer and device-tree-compiler are
# optional dependencies.
# If you wish to emulate ARM, you will want device-tree-compiler.
#
# NOTES:
#   This version breaks some backward compatibility with earlier versions.
#   Consult the official changelogs for details.

OPTIONAL:
spice
usbredir
virglrenderer
device-tree-compiler
